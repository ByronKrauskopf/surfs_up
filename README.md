- There were 1700 temperature readings for the month of June while December had 1517, which is a reduction of 10.76%. Despite the lower number of readings in December thear are still of sufficient amount for the subsequent statistics to be considered valid. 
- There is only a 2°F differnece between the max temperature for June (85°F) and the max temperature for December (83°F).
- There is an 8°F difference between the minimum temperature for June (64°F) and the minimum temperature for December (56°F).
- There is a 4°F difference between the average temperature for June (75°F) and the average temperature for December (71°).


## Summary

Based on the analisys of temperature Oahu, Hawaii would appear to be an ideal location for a Surf'n'Shake shop as there is little season variabtion. The waether is uniformly warm throughout the year. However, business will potentially be impacted by more then just temperature.  A similar anlaysis on precipitation needs to be considered as well.
